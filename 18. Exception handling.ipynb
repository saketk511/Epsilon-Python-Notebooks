    "Exception handling in Python is a mechanism that allows you to handle errors gracefully and prevent your program from crashing unexpectedly. When an error occurs, an exception is raised, and you can use try-except blocks to catch and handle these exceptions.\n",

    "Basic Structure\n",
    "The basic structure of exception handling in Python consists of try, except, else, and finally blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "try: This block contains the code that might raise an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "except: This block contains the code that runs if an exception occurs in the try block.\n",
    "\n",
    "else: This block contains code that runs if no exceptions occur in the try block.\n",
    "\n",
    "finally: This block contains code that runs regardless of whether an exception occurred or not."
